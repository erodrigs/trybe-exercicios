## About Trybe

Trybe is a programming school that teaches you how to program, study and work, using modern concepts and methodologies, and with the difference that the student can choose to pay for the course only after completing the training.

## The Trybe course is divided into four modules, namely:

+ Fundamentals of web development
+ Front end development
+ Back end development
+ Computer Science

## Course status

I am currently studying at the end of module 2, which deals with technologies related to the front end, but I am redoing some exercises from the beginning of the course, as well as doing code review of previous projects.

## Technologies

So far, we have studied several technologies used in software development, and among them I can highlight:
