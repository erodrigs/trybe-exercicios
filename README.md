<h1>Trybe Exercises</h1>

> Status: Continous development ⚠️

### In this repository, I will add the exercises developed during the Trybe Web Development course

## The Trybe course is divided into four modules, namely:

+ Fundamentals of web development
+ Front end development
+ Back end development
+ Computer Science

## Course status

I am currently studying at the end of module 2, which deals with technologies related to the front end, but I am redoing some exercises from the beginning of the course, as well as doing code review of previous projects.
